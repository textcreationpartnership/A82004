            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my laſt letter I wrote to you of a Commiſſion that came hither, and brought by one <hi>Thomas Bourke</hi> a Papiſt, who was of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons here, and one of thoſe Committees ſent over by the Houſe of Commons here into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> mine time of the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> triall; the ſubſtance of which Commiſſion for ought I can hear is no other then that I wrote you word of before, to receive the Demands of the Rebels: the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Raſcommen,</hi> my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> Sir <hi>Maurice Eustace,</hi> the Kings Sarjeant, and this <hi>Bourke</hi> being Commiſſioners, though this be all in the Commiſſion that I can learn, yet the Papiſts do much rejoyce here, and bragge that they ſhall have their wills and what they pleaſe (ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly I hope are they abuſed by their Prieſts and others who tells them of wonders, when I doubt not, but it will be but <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculus mus</hi>) for ſure His Majeſtie is ſenſible of the blood of his Engliſh Subjects ſo barbarouſly ſpent and ſpilt by thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels here, which by a remonſtration given in here unto the State is no leſſe then an hundred fourtie foure thouſand in the Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> onely which by the Rebels have beene hanged, killed, drowned, ſtoned, and now miſſing there. And if ſo many in one of the foure Provinces, what are there in the other three Provinces? The place appointed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to receive what the Rebels offer, is Troudaiſh; the time I heare which is appointed is the 23. of this inſtant: they are to come thither not above thirtie, and of them none to be of their Clergie; They have a ſafe conduct ſent them unto
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155743:3"/>
               <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and are to have a Convoy for to ſecure them in their paſſage if they doubt any thing. What will be the iſſue of it time will ſhew, but you muſt not look for ſuch conſtant Intelligences as heretofore; for 'tis reported here, that Captaine <hi>Bartlet</hi> who commanded the Pinnace, and ſerved the State upon theſe Coaſts, and to runne betweene <hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> have delivered his Ordnance out of his ſhip, being ſixteen in number, to fortifie <hi>Westchester,</hi> and have moored up his ſhip there as tis given out, and for his excuſe doth ſay, he hath done it by the command of thoſe who have power to do it.</p>
            <p>For our eſtate here it is much after the old manner, we cannot ſtirre out of <hi>Dublin</hi> but the poore Engliſh are ſwept up, if they go not out ſtrongly. On Munday was a ſeven night at noon day, an hundred and fourtie of the Calves which the poore Engliſh that dwelt in <hi>Dublin</hi> had, were ſwept all away by the Rebels from the Greene of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Oxmanton</hi> Greene, and carried cleane away without reſiſtance, which will adde to our ſcarcitie, it being too much alreadie, and which if we be not ſoone relieved. I feare we muſt abandon this Kingdome for want of victuals; and whither we poore few that are left ſhould go to begge, if <hi>England</hi> be not quiet, we do not know onely our eyes wait upon that great provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which yet hath been wonderfull towards us in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>On Friday was ſeventh night Sir <hi>Francis Willoughby</hi> went with 1500. Foot, and three Troops of Horſe to <hi>Mennooth,</hi> where the Rebels were in great multitudes; but upon his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach they fired the towne, and ſome of them betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Caſtle, where they endured about ninetie great ſhot from our Ordnance, and then in the night ſtole all away. Such ill luck hath Sir <hi>Francis</hi> ſtill, that the Rebels ſlip away from him when he ſhould come to execution: and for the preſent there is a garriſon of two hundred men put into it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall continue there, or how long we know not, but the reſt of the ſouldiers are come home.</p>
            <p>I wrote to you alſo in my laſt of a Convoy of a thouſand foot and about two hundred horſe, ſent to <hi>Athlowe</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:155743:3"/>from hence with Ammonition and proviſions for reliefe of the Souldiers there, amongſt which were ſome clothes for the Souldiers, what the ſtate here could ſpare, and that very hardly, they went ſafely thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in their coming back about two miles of this ſide of <hi>Mullingare,</hi> in <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> at a place called <hi>Rawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi> their way was through a paſſe or cawſey over a bogge, the bogge being on both ſides the cawſey, which the Rebels had purpoſely ſo cut and ſpoiled, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horſe nor foot could poſſibly paſſe over it: and at the hither end towards <hi>Dublin</hi> the Rebels had made works and trenches to lie in, to cut off our men in their returne; In thoſe trenches and that ſide, they had (as the certaineſt reports are of them that were there) 2500. men, and on a hill a little from the bogge, a thouſand men more, and in another place 700. more, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys thereabout riſing and making towards them, their Generaliſſimo <hi>Preſton</hi> had ſent his eldeſt ſonne, who was a Collonel amongſt them, with many of his beſt men unto that place to their help. Our men ſeeing the ſtraight that they were in, and having no other way to paſſe but that way through the bogge, ſent Serjeant Major <hi>Morris</hi> a young man, who ſometimes was the late Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> Page, with the forlorne Hope to try the bogge, he commanded his man to lead his horſe after him: and finding that the bottome of the bogge was gravelly, though they went up to the ankles, and ſometimes to the knees, yet reſolvedly he went on and got over, and then called to our horſe to follow, which they did with what ſpeed they could: and ſo ſoon as ſome few of them were got over they were charged by one Captaine <hi>Bryan</hi> (whom I formerly wrote to you ran away from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155743:4"/>us, he being then Cornet to Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> and whoſe plot was to have carried with him two or thre troops of our horſe, (they were received bravely by our men, though but newly got out of the mire) and though <hi>Bryan</hi> gave them three charges with great courage and fierceneſſe, yet his men could not endure the face of our horſe, but preſently fled and ranne away. When <hi>Bryan</hi> was ſlain, and his head carried to Droggedah, our foot likewiſe waded through the bogge with great courage, and were no ſooner got through, but they charged the Rebels in their very trenches, and with ſuch furie and reſolution, that they came up to the very loopholes where they put out the nuzzels of their Muskets, and ſo couragiouſly beat them out of their trenches, and made them to betake them to their heels, and they followed the chaſe about 6. miles. How many of the Rebels were killed is uncertain, for none can tell that were there but by gueſſe: ſome think 400. at leaſt, and many of good note, and their beſt men, amongſt whom was <hi>Adam Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacke,</hi> one of our great ſpeakers in our Parliament. There were taken Collonell <hi>Preston,</hi> the Generall <hi>Preſtons</hi> eldeſt ſonne, who is now in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and as ſome of them that were there ſay, and I heare it confirmed by Sir <hi>John Sherlocke,</hi> that <hi>Betangh</hi> of <hi>Menaltagh</hi> his eldeſt ſonne, and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Otylemer</hi> the Lawyer, his eldeſt ſonne, which two, they ſay, they left at <hi>Trim,</hi> with ſome others of their beſt men. There were eleven of their Colours taken, ſome ſay ſixteen, but I ſaw but ten brought into <hi>Dublin,</hi> if I miſtooke not in the telling them as they were brought.</p>
            <p>This we account as great a Victory, as that of <hi>Killruſh,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering all the difficulties that were therein, and the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that the enemie had of us, and we muſt not, nor ought we to aſcribe it to any policie or ſtrength of ours, but to the immediate hand of our good God, who as in our former
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155743:4"/>fights, ſo in this, ſhewed his owne power and mercy to us, and even miraculouſly preſerved us, and gave us this victory. There were but foure or five of our men killed in all this fight, and ſome twentie hurt, but not mortally, that I can heare of Sir <hi>Richard Grenvile</hi> commanded the Horſe in chiefe, and Sir <hi>John Sherlocke</hi> the Foote, Sir <hi>Michael Ernely</hi> was there alſo with them, who is accounted amongſt our Souldiers as brave a Commander, as we have any, and Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Povey,</hi> and the Lord Preſident of <hi>Connaught,</hi> who are all come to <hi>Dublin,</hi> but Sir <hi>Michael Earnely,</hi> who fell ſicke at <hi>Trim</hi> by the way, where he is. This battell was fought yeſterday ſennight, and the Newes came to us on thurſday, and our Souldiers came home on Saturday laſt.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the laſt Summer, there were ſent into <hi>Connaught,</hi> with Sir <hi>Michael Earnly,</hi> and other Commanders, two thouſand men, which came to us from <hi>Chester;</hi> of theſe there came up with our Convoy now from <hi>Athlew,</hi> onely ſix hundred men, and in that diſtreſſed miſerable caſe, that it would pittie any mans heart, that had but one dram of mercy in him to ſee them; they are almoſt ſtarved, and ſome now dye comming to get a little fulneſſe of meate, and I feare many of them will follow that way. So ragged and naked are they for want of cloaths, as I never ſaw Souldiers in all my dayes: and ſome of them dyed by the way, not being able to travaile up, and almoſt all of the reſt of the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand that went downe, beſides theſe ſix hundred, are dead in <hi>Connaught,</hi> of meere hunger and ſickneſſe, as the Souldiers ſay; For they doe report that few or none were killed by the enemie.</p>
            <p>As I ſaid before, our wants here increaſe very much, and if we have not ſupplyes ſpeedily ſent us out of <hi>England,</hi> what wee ſhall doe, or which way to turne us, or whither to goe, wee know not, and if we have no helpe from you, we cannot continue long; for if wee wanted nothing but victualls, that were enough to deſtroy us all.</p>
            <p>They are preparing here to ſend out about two thouſand men, horſe and foote, this next weeke, but whither they ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155743:5"/>goe, is kept ſecret; it was a motion made by my Lord <hi>Liſle,</hi> which wee thinke came originally from Collonell <hi>Munke;</hi> both which, as we heare, are to goe in the ſervice: they carry Battering Pieces with them, and Quernes for grinding of Corne, and if God bleſſe them, we thinke they will not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily returne; for in truth, we have no victualls for them. And thus with my kindeſt reſpects to you, I reſt</p>
